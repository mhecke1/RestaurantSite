			<h2>Custard!</h2>
			<p>This recipe started off as tirimisu but sometimes I get lazy so to me its basically the first half of tirimisu</p>
			<p>I plan to add ingredients soon but until then this page will just be a teaser.</p>
			<p>Sabayon or Zabaione is  always basically Whipped egg yolks combined with sugar some other type of flavoring and some form of alcohol.
			My favorite as I have already said is the sabayon used as the first part of a traditional tiramisu recipe.</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>6 eggs</li>
			    <li>1 third cup of sugar</li>
			    <li>1 teaspoon Vanilla extract</li>
			    <li>1 Tabelspoon Ameretto</li>
		    </ul>
		    <p>Usually for tiramisu I dip the lady fingers in espresso and thats how the whole thing get its coffee flavor alone 
		        but if you are just eating the sabayon alone you can put espresso in with the vanilla and ameretto</p>
