			<h2>Eggs!</h2>
			<p>There is no secret ingredient to good eggs but there is still a secret... hard work. The problem with most peoples scrambled eggs is that eggs in general cook very, very fast and cooked eggs acts as an insulator to uncooked eggs. This is why its very easy to have watery eggs. you leave the eggs along for even a second and the part of the eggs that is touching the pan gets overcooked and the part thats not stays watery. This isn't always a bad thing, such as  in the case of omeletes. infact other countries prefer not to overcook the outside part of their omeletes and just opt for really watery omelete insides. Americans think that the solution to watery scrambled eggs is to add milk which will make them "fluffier"; nothing could be further from the truth. The real secret to scrambled eggs that are velvety through and through is in multiple parts. The first thing is to not add any salt until they are done, salt destroys everything and it starts destroying the egg the moment you add it in. The second thing is to not mix them up and break them down until they are in the pan or pot and cooking. The longer eggs are "scrambled" before they are cooked the more watery they are going to be. The third thing is butter. Butter is typically added to the pot to keep the eggs from sticking but it also changes the distribution and rate at which the eggs cook this is why pam is always a bad idea for scrambled eggs but not so bad for omletes.</p>
			<p>Now that we've got that out of the way just add the eggs to the pot or pan (I preffer pot as its harder to spill) add the butter and any cheese you wanted to add and put it on an element at low to medium heat and start stirring.when its starting to look like the eggs are starting to cook too fast take the pot off the element but dont stop stirring. Repeat this process over and over and you will find that the egg cook completely evenly and you have that heavenly texture that you see in commercials.</p>
